Project Name: Mc #5 Eight To Ten - Endpoints
Description: Made a api that has 5 endpoints for the GuessIt(3), Resturant Picker(1), and Magic 8 Ball (1) assignments. Hard coded validation per Chris suggestion
Peer Review:Chris Wells-Hott
Comments Great Work On your validation for the guessit when I typed a letter It didnt prompt me to type a number. Maybe next time create a way so the user can only type a number.Hope that makes sense,other than that great work.
